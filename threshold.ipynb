    "Carefully observe the animation below in Figure 1. How many numbers do you see? Most of you will see several numbers. But there is more to the image than meets the eye.\n",
    "Input image to be used for image thresholding in OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"./thresholding_image/threshold.gif\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "As the image cycles through the animation, you will see the thresholded version of the original image, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * All the numbers look completely white (i.e. they have a grayscale value of 255).\n",
    "    * You can also see the number ‘5’, which was present but invisible in the original image, simply because its grayscale value was 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, all the numbers in the original image have a grayscale value equal to the value of the number. So, ‘255’ is the brightest and ‘5’ the darkest. Recall that grayscale intensities range from pure black (0) to pure white (255).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, reading numbers in the thresholded image is much easier than reading numbers in the original image. Not surprisingly, even text-recognition algorithms find it easier to process a thresholded image over the original. Thresholding therefore has numerous applications in computer vision, and is often performed in the initial stages in  many processing pipelines. There are several types of thresholding algorithms. Let’s focus on  ‘global’ thresholding here.\n",

    "So, what is ‘global’ thresholding? When the thresholding rule is applied equally to every pixel in the image, and the threshold value is fixed, the operations are called global.\n",
    "\n",
    "Global thresholding algorithms take a source image (src) and a threshold value (thresh) as input, and produce an output image (dst), by comparing the pixel intensity at source pixel location (x,y) to the threshold. If src(x,y) > thresh, then dst(x,y) is assigned some value. Otherwise, dst(x,y) is assigned some other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of global thresholding is called Binary Thresholding.\n",
    "\n",
    "     * In addition to the source image (src) and the threshold value (thresh ), it takes another input parameter called the maximum value (maxValue).\n",
    "     * At each pixel location (x,y), the pixel intensity at that location is compared to  a threshold value,  thresh .\n",
    "\n",
    "If src(x,y) is greater than thresh, the thresholding operation sets the value of the destination image pixel dst(x,y) to the maxValue. Otherwise, it sets it to 0, as shown in the pseudo code below.\n",
    "\n",

    "We discussed how thresholding can be used to isolate certain objects in an image. Several global-thresholding algorithms were demonstrated, and we provided code examples for each. You learned how even a single function in OpenCV can perform different types of thresholding, by simply passing the appropriate thresholding flag."
